## Using Conda

[![Conda](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/deezer-research/spleeter)](https://anaconda.org/deezer-research/spleeter)

The easiest way to install **Spleeter** is probably to use `conda`. You need first
to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io), for instance using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

> ⚠️ For **Windows** users we highly recommend to use a complete [Anaconda installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/). You may otherwise have to manually install `ffmpeg`.

We provide already provisioned packages for most platforms, you can thus install **Spleeter** by simply running :

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge # only needed if you don't already have this channel set
conda install -c deezer-research spleeter 
```

All dependencies required to make **Spleeter** work will be installed in your environment as well as the **Spleeter** library itself.

Note: there used to be a `spleeter-gpu` package that was merged into the `spleeter` package (following `tensorflow` single package for both CPU and GPU). 

> ⚠️ For Mac users, installing **Spleeter** with `conda` will install an older version. If you want to run the latest version, you can install **Spleeter** with `pip` (see next section).

## Using pip

**Spleeter** could also be installed directly using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) package manager, assuming that following dependencies are installed first :

- [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org)
- [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)<sup>2</sup>

> <sup>2</sup> only needed if you plan to perform evaluation.

If you do not feel comfortable installing these dependencies, we recommend an [installation with conda](./1.-Installation#using-conda).

Note that the dependencies can be installed with `conda` on any platform before using `pip` for installing **Spleeter**:
```bash
conda install ffmpeg libsndfile
````

You can then install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org) repository :

```bash
pip install spleeter
```
> ⚠️ Running **Spleeter** on *Nvidia GPUs* devices require you to have a proper [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) installation. We recommend to use the provided *GPU* [Docker image](./2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).
