## Using Conda

The easiest way to use **Spleeter** is probably to use it with conda. You need first
to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io), for instance using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

We provide two [conda](https://docs.conda.io) environment files :

- [spleeter-cpu.yaml](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/conda/spleeter-cpu.yaml) for *CPU* devices.
- [spleeter-gpu.yaml](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/conda/spleeter-cpu.yaml) for *GPU* devices<sup>1</sup>.

Assuming that you have a [git](https://git-scm.com) client installed, you can create and activate your environment as following :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deezer/spleeter
conda env create -f spleeter/conda/spleeter-cpu.yaml
conda activate spleeter-cpu
```

All dependencies required to make **Spleeter** work would be installed in your environment as well as **Spleeter** library itself.

> <sup>1</sup> running **Spleeter** on *Nvidia GPU* devices require you to have a proper [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) driver installation.

## Using pip

**Spleeter** could also be installed directly using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) package manager, assuming that following dependencies are installed first :

- [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org)
- [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)<sup>2</sup>

> <sup>2</sup> only needed if you plan to perform evaluation.

If you do not feel confortable installing these dependencies, we recommend an [installation with conda](./1.-Installation#using-conda).

You can then install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org) repository :

```bash
pip install spleeter
```
> ⚠️ `pip` based install method does not support *GPU*. If you need to run **Spleeter** on *GPU* devices, we recommend an [installation with conda](./1.-Installation#using-conda) or to use the provided *GPU* [Docker image](./2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).
