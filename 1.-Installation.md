## Using Conda

The easiest way to use **Spleeter** is probably to use it with conda. You need first
to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io), for instance using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

> ⚠️ For **Windows** users we highly recommend you use a complete [Anaconda installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/). You may otherwise have to manually install `ffmpeg`

We provide already provisioned packages for most platforms on [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org), you can thus install _Spleeter_ by simply running :

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge spleeter
```

We also provide a _GPU_<sup>1</sup> ready package :

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge spleeter-gpu
```

All dependencies required to make **Spleeter** work would be installed in your environment as well as **Spleeter** library itself.

> <sup>1</sup> running **Spleeter** on *Nvidia GPU* devices require you to have a proper [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) driver installation.

> <sup>1</sup> ⚠️ please note that we do not provide support for _MacOS_ platforms with `spleeter-gpu` [conda](https://docs.conda.io) package.

## Using pip

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/spleeter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/spleeter)

**Spleeter** could also be installed directly using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) package manager, assuming that following dependencies are installed first :

- [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org)
- [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)<sup>2</sup>

> <sup>2</sup> only needed if you plan to perform evaluation.

If you do not feel confortable installing these dependencies, we recommend an [installation with conda](./1.-Installation#using-conda).

You can then install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org) repository :

```bash
pip install spleeter
```
> ⚠️ `pip` based install method does not support *GPU*. If you need to run **Spleeter** on *GPU* devices, we recommend an [installation with conda](./1.-Installation#using-conda) or to use the provided *GPU* [Docker image](./2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).
